Client of [sonarqube api](https://sonarcloud.io/web_api) in golang
## Compatibility
As `sonarqube api` is updated frequently, this client now only support [v7.4](https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarqube-7-4/). Forward compatibility is not  guaranteed in this version (To be done).

## Usage

```go
import github.com/magicsong/sonargo/sonar
```

Construct a new Sonarqube client, then use the various services on the client to access different parts of the Sonarqube API. For example, to list all projects:

```go
sonarURL := os.Getenv("SONAR_URL")
if sonarURL == "" {
    fmt.Println("Sonar URL has not been set")
    os.Exit(1)
}
client, err := sonargo.NewClient(sonarURL+"/api", "user", "password")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err.Error())
    os.Exit(1)
}
//set options
opt := &ProjectsSearchOption{
    AnalyzedBefore:    "",
    OnProvisionedOnly: "",
    P:                 "",
    ProjectIds:        "",
    Projects:          "",
    Ps:                "",
    Q:                 "",
    Qualifiers:        "",
}
v, _, err := client.Projects.Search(opt)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err.Error())
    os.Exit(1)
}
fmt.Print(v.Components[0])
```

Other services is also like `Projects`, using following steps:
1. Get a client  by use `NewClient()`
2. Get the service by simply using dot. The service name is `CamelCase` of the name in sonarqube api
3. Use functions of each service to do what you want to do

## Notes
- Most code in first release version is generated by code. So some naming is not suitable. See [generate-go-for-sonarqube](https://github.com/magicsong/generate-go-for-sonarqube)
- Sonarqube community does not build a v7.4 docker image for public, so a v7.4 dockerfile is provided in [build](https://github.com/magicsong/sonargo/tree/master/build) folder. 

## ToDo
* [ ] Add godoc for each api
* [ ] Add more tests
* [ ] test forward compatibility
